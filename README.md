Android Week View
=================

**Notice:** To have more control and no delay because of pull requests and release cycles, I started my own fork.

New Features
------------
* Merged pull request https://github.com/Quivr/Android-Week-View/pull/84 to get rid of the input lag

* Merged (my own) pull request https://github.com/Quivr/Android-Week-View/pull/86 to have some nice prefetching

* Latest gradle dependencies

* Manual control of "All day events" header's visibility if there are no events: weekView.alwaysShowAllDayEventGap(true)

* Set number of visible days with horizontal scale gesture

  


**Android Week View** is an android library to display calendars (week view or day view) within the app. It supports custom styling.
